Hi there! I'm so glad you are here. The projects mentioned below go from the beginning of my journey learning data analytics to the present. They use a range of different programming languages and resources. 

My goal with learning the skills required to run these projects is to one day help create a healthy relationship between humans and technology. In the next couple years I hope to get involved in projects that can help people directly that being under a medical industry or under a non-profit. I take interest in teaching others about data and online habits giving them the opportunity to excel in their goals.
